  <!-- Randy Random -->
  <Randy.label></Randy.label>
  <!-- Randy doesn't follow rules. He'll generate random events, and he doesn't care if they make a story of triumph or utter hopelessness. It's all drama to him.\n\nWarning: Since Randy is truly random, he will sometimes send extremely difficult or unfair groups of events at you. It makes for high drama - and unavoidable sacrifices. -->
