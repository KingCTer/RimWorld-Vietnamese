  <BorealForest.description></BorealForest.description>

  <!-- tundra -->

  <Tundra.description></Tundra.description>

  <!-- cold bog -->
  <ColdBog.label></ColdBog.label>
  <!-- A wetland packed with trees and vines. Much of the marshy land here can't support heavy structures, moving around is slow due to choking vegetation. Disease is endemic in this dense, wet ecosystem. -->
  <ColdBog.description></ColdBog.description>

  <!-- ice sheet -->
  <IceSheet.label></IceSheet.label>
  <!-- Sheets of ice which can be kilometers thick. There is no soil for plants to grow in. The only animals here are migrating to somewhere else - or badly lost. -->
  <IceSheet.description></IceSheet.description>

  <!-- sea ice -->
  <SeaIce.label></SeaIce.label>
